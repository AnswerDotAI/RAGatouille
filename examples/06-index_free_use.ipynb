    "# Using ColBERT in-memory: Index-Free Encodings & Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, building an index doesn't make sense. Maybe you're working with a really small dataset, or one that is really fleeting nature, and will only be relevant to the lifetime of your current instance. In these cases, it can be more efficient to skip all the time-consuming index optimisation, and keep your encodings in-memory to perform ColBERT's magical MaxSim on-the-fly. This doesn't scale very well, but can be very useful in certain settings.\n",
