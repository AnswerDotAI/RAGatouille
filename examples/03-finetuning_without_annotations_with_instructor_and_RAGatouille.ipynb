    "In the [previous example](https://github.com/bclavie/RAGatouille/blob/main/examples/02-basic_training.ipynb), we experimented with training our own ColBERT model. The process was straightforward, but our resulting model wasn't very useful: we didn't have any of the annotated data needed, so we created meaningless `[query, relevant_passage]` pairs that the model couldn't learn anything from!\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting annotated data is expensive! Thankfully, the litterature in retrieval has recently shown that synthetic data can yield similar, if not better, performance when fine-tuning retrieval models. This means we can fine-tune to our target domain without **needing pricey and time-consuming annotations**.\n",
    "\n",
