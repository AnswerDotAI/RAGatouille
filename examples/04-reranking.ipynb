    "So why not just use rerank() on the whole index if it's so good? Well, you could, but it's not very efficient. ColBERT is an extremely fast querier, but it needs to have an index built to do so. When you're using ColBERT to rerank documents, it's doing it index-free, which means it needs to encode all your documents and queries, and perform the comparison on the fly. This is fine for a handful of document on CPU or a few hundreds on GPU, but it's going to take exponentially longer as you add more documents!\n",

    "Re-ranking the results of another retrieval method is a good compromise: it allows you to leverage ColBERT's power without having to modify the rest of your pipeline, just increase the `k` value of your retriever and let ColBERT rescore them!"
